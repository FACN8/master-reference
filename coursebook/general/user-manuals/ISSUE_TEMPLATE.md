## How I get my best work done: 
When approaching a problem or a new project I like to plan a lot in advance, probably usually too much. This is something I need to work on and sometimes allow myself to improvise more and be less analytical. 

## The role I usually take in a team:  
I feel the best when I am working in teams where there is no one strong leader and where responsibilities are shared, and all participants have more or less equal input to the final result. As a member of different teams I like to come up with general idea or direction for a project. I also always try to engage other participants.

## My communication style: 
When addressing some issues I tend to be straight forward and avoid getting personal. I think sensible and open communication at every stage of a project is key to success. 

## What I value:
I value straightforwardness, communicating your opinions in an honest and open way and being respectful to others.  

## What people misunderstand about me: 
I might come across as a quite shy.

## How I like to get my feedback:
I think I am quite flexible and open to a different point of views and always trying to find a balance that would satisfy all contributors to a project. The key here is to getting across your opinions or views in a non-judgmental and respectful way.
