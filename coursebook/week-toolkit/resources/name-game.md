# Name game :thinking:

An informal exercise to help students, mentors and FAC alumni to quickly remember each other's names (and learn a little bit about each other).

Get as many FAC alumni in the classroom as possible, as well as current students, and form a circle. Each person tells the room their name and one interesting fact about themselves, but not before they've first recounted the names and facts of those who have gone before them. 

This means that the first person will only have to say their own name and fact, whilst the last person has to try and remember the whole circle's! 

(Giving hints and helping each other is inevitable and encouraged)
