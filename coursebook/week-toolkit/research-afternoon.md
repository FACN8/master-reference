# Research Afternoon

## Command Line
1. What is the command line?
2. Why might you want to customize it?
3. Research how to:
  + customise your command line to make it pretty and useful (ie. git branch/branch status parser)
  + install using a package manager
4. Create a "workshop", designed to walk the rest of your cohort through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)

## Regular Expressions
1. What is regex? Why would I use it? What are some examples of common regex usage?
2. Research:
  + How to use regex
    + (basic) pattern creation and repetitions
    + (advanced) groups
  + Find and use on-line tools such as [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
2. Create a code snippet using regex such as (for example) email validator:
+ us3r1@foundersandcoders.com
  + user must start with an alphabetical character;
  + user can contain also other characters (which ones?);
  + site and user are always separated by a snail/small duck/AT symbol (@);
  + site is always done with at least 3 alphabetical characters, a dot and at least 2 more alphabetical characters

## Accessibility
1. What does web accessibility mean and why is it important?
2. What is semantic HTML? Why should we avoid the use of divs? What tag should appear on every page?
2. What are some basic accessibility checks that can be included in all of our projects? 
3. Research how to:
  + write an accessible navbar
  + write an accessible modal  
  (Hint: think about semantic HTML, managing focus, adding key handlers, adding aria attributes)
4. Refactor one of your team's websites (or one from the rest of your cohort if necessary) to reflect what you've learned

## CSS
1. What is responsive design? How does it compare to adaptive design?
2. Compare the pros and cons of a desktop-first versus mobile-first approach to design. What do you think is generally preferable?
3. What is BEM CSS and why does it matter?
4. Compare the % and vw/vh units. What are the pros and cons of each? Where might you use each?
5. Compare ems and rems as font size units. Why are they used and what would your advice be to someone choosing between the two?
6. Refactor one of your team's websites to reflect what you've learned
